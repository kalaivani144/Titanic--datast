Thanks for uploading the screenshots. Here's a breakdown of whatâ€™s shown in each image and what you might want to include in your report or presentation:

---

### âœ… Screenshot Summaries:

#### **Screenshot 1: "Screenshot 2025-06-02 223238.png"**

* **Content:** Likely shows part of the decision matrix used in the Weighted Entropy Method.
* **Observation:** It includes MRR, SR, and KW valuesâ€”probably normalized and weighted.
* **Suggestion:** Use this image or recreate the table in your report section on *Normalized Decision Matrix with Weighted Values*. Clearly explain:

  * How normalization was done.
  * How the weights were applied.
  * How the weighted normalized matrix was used to calculate overall scores.

---

#### **Screenshot 2: "Screenshot 2025-06-02 223533.png"**

* **Content:** Appears to show a partial ranking table of alternatives.
* **Observation:** One alternative is highlighted (possibly the optimal setting).
* **Suggestion:** Add this to your *Results and Discussion* section. Include:

  * A brief explanation of what each alternative corresponds to (e.g., Run 1 = Ton 100, Toff 50, SV 3).
  * A ranking chart or bar graph to visualize which setting performed best.

---

#### **Screenshot 3: "Screenshot 2025-06-02 223547.png"**

* **Content:** Might be showing the entropy values or weight calculation step.
* **Observation:** Appears to have entropy and derived weights.
* **Suggestion:** In your methodology section, explain:

  * How entropy was computed.
  * The formula used to derive criteria weights.
  * Emphasize that entropy helps reflect the inherent information diversity of each criterion.

#### **Screenshot 4: "Screenshot 2025-06-02 223722.png"**

* **Content:** Likely the normalized decision matrix (pre-weighting).
* **Observation:** Values look like theyâ€™ve been scaled between 0 and 1.
* **Suggestion:** Place this under *Normalization of Decision Matrix*. Clarify:

  * Whether smaller-the-better (for SR, KW) and larger-the-better (for MRR) criteria were considered.
  * Which normalization method was used (e.g., linear normalization).

---

#### **Screenshot 5: "Screenshot 2025-06-02 223811.png"**

* **Content:** Seems to include final performance scores (possibly closeness coefficients or weighted sums).
* **Observation:** Shows final ranks and scores.
* **Suggestion:** Include a table or figure titled *Final Weighted Scores and Ranking*.

  * Add a sentence or two interpreting why the top-ranked setting performed best (e.g., balance between high MRR and low SR/KW).

### ðŸ“˜ What to Write in the Report (Briefly):

You can structure the *Weighted Entropy Method* section like this:

1. **Step 1: Normalize the Decision Matrix**

   * Describe normalization based on the nature of criteria.
   * Include Screenshot 4 (or recreate table in MS Word).

2. **Step 2: Calculate Entropy and Weights**

   * Explain entropy calculation and its role in assigning importance.
   * Insert Screenshot 3 with equations and interpretation.

3. **Step 3: Weighted Normalized Matrix**

   * Multiply normalized values by their weights.
   * Use Screenshot 1 for illustration.

4. **Step 4: Compute Performance Scores**

   * Show how the final scores were calculated (e.g., sum of weighted values).
   * Use Screenshot 5.

5. **Step 5: Ranking of Alternatives**

   * Describe ranking process.
   * Insert Screenshot 2, and explain which setting was best and why.
